Called customer and left a VM message to return my call. ";"2018-06-21 13:55:53.237983";"2018-06-21 08:53:24.445104
The pizza prep cooler at El Jefe - SKS062018-D1-24 - did not need the controller we rec'd in advance of the call. They needed the green switch. Whomever had been working on it bypassed part of it and hardwired the other side of it. 
We corrected the wiring, replaced the switch from one we had, adjusted the controller's parameters as they were all over the place and they are up and going. 
Can you guys send me another green switch to have on hand?  UPS/Ground is fine. * part ordered

Eddie (In House Tech.) went to go service the unit on 6/20/18 in the morning and the employee would not allow him to enter to service the unit due the employee not being informed of repair by management. Eddie was unable to get in contact with the contact on service call so he is going to have to reschedule service call.

7/5/18--Eddie was caught up on service calls and asked if I could dispatch this service call to a 3rd party tech. was unable to find another tech. -Have to send Eddie and customer also has an issue with her sink that Eddie may have to repair…..I updated the customer via email---> 7/9/18-I emailed th e customer stating"" On Saturday, July 7th I was informed by my technician that he came to service your unit on Saturday, July 7th. and due to the unit being turned on and hot he was unable to perform the necessary work needed to fix the unit. He informed me that he then informed you that he would have to schedule service for another time. Our technician was then approached by a male at the business in a confrontational manner informing him that ""he did not need to speak to you that way"" and then the male proceeded to follow the technician all the way outside to his vehicle when he was trying to leave and then informed him that ""if he wanted to box he had some boxing gloves"". Violence in no shape, form, or fashion will be tolerated and due to that issue I will not be sending out any other technician to service your unit due to fear of their safety. If you are wanting to get your unit fixed you can call your own technician and pay for it and get reimbursed through the warranty process. As far as your sink, I have sent you the faucet knobs that should correct that issue. They should be arriving tomorrow. Being that the sink has no warranty we only sent the part and the assembly of the part will have to be done on your end.

I do apologize for all of the inconvenience. If you do call a technician and he is in need of parts or instruction he can always contact me or technical support and we will provide the proper assistance he needs. Atosa also has a limit of what they will pay for particular repairs which is to not to exceed $300.00. If the technician feels the invoice amount is going to exceed that then they need to call technical support to get approval. ";"2018-07-11 14:51:55.654284";"2018-06-25 09:54:21.555974

The issue at this TipIcos food truck wasn't a power switch.
They had two (2)-thIngs going on....
It needed a controller and we had one on the truck from another call that wasn't needed. We set the parameters. We also had the condensing unit receiving power but not running. We had to trace the wiring to find a short in the molex plug to the condensing unit itself. We repaired and seated the plug and saw it come down to 33 degrees F and cycle. They are up and running.

I gave them the new dial wheel and told them there was nothing wrong with it. Charlie confirmed. They just emphasized the temperature was not right in the afternoon. I told them to reset the temperature above a little bit higher if they felt wrong. If too much food cocking, the temperature would drop for sure. 
If the guys, Kim continue call you, please tell him to reset the temperature!!!

We understand that this service on MKC58 is one where the tech said there was an issue that needed special attention: cabinet temp 36degF / beer serving temp 42degF. That Charlie was contacting China about it; that it would take until next week for help and resolution from China. The customer Happy Garden was advised to talk to his dealer if he was not willing to wait for resolution from China. He is not willing to wait.

I spoke with our dealer T&T Restaurant Supply about this; they are going to swap out the defective MKC58 at Happy Garden for one they have in their warehouse, since SF warehouse does not have any in stock to sell.  We will support them, once they advise that they have the defective unit back in their warehouse and re-packaged, by arranging to pick up the defective unit at their warehouse and credit them for the return.";"2018-07-06 14:08:22.693124";"4708 Roseville Rd. # 107";"";"North Highland";"CA";"95660";"11:30 AM- 9:00 PM";1;"";0;"2018-06-25 20:29:59.462921";0;0

Tech. called back stating that he informed the customer that the unit was getting too hot due to where it is positioned in his food truck next to a hot unit. When they keep opening and closing the door the heat from the outside comes in and makes the unit too hot cutting off the compressor. The unit  was tested in the morning and everything worked fine. The tech. changed the parts we sent just in case but he knows that was not the issue.

CLOSING CASE. ";"2018-07-27 17:35:48.216056";"2018-07-24 15:27:34.882518
Upon tech investigation, the original issue does not appear to be a door issue, but other factors. Tech went to site to troubleshoot and  found the molding was not snapped into place which was causing the water to drip down into the door.  It was adjusted and the issue was resolved. However, a day later the issue persisted as the glass started to fog on the inside causing condensation to gather and drip. Tech went out again to adjust the temp as it might have been adjusted too cold. After speaking with the tech, and the customer, Kyle decided the door should be replaced anyway. 
2018-07-27 12:10:35.746038
PER KYLE TO REPLACE THE UNIT AS THE SHIPPING FOR THE DOOR  IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN REPLACING THE UNIT, BUT TO GET A HOLD OF THE CUSTOMER FIRST TO DETERMINE IF THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD LIKE DONE.

Spoke with customer who states the unit is 3 weeks old and water is pooling on the bottom inside the unit and leaking from the opening where a drain hose should be, but was not initially included with the unit. The water that leaks on the outside pools on the bottom of the unit under the compressor so when they move the unit to clean it, the water spills all over the floor.

Found this unit with no Freon due to a leak in the liquid line that sits in the drain pan to help the water evaporate. I fixed the leak but the unit ie restricted. 
I will need a new liquid line section that sits in drain pan, a new cap tube and a new filter drier to fix this unit.

He spend 2 hours working on the unit. He replaced the filter drier and added a pound of Freon. I have a video of the leak on the filter drier if you need that.

However, the customer called late on Sunday afternoon and said the case was starting to get warm again.  They were going to call and place another service request. Please call and we can discuss.

Tech was onsite with the evap coil that we sent which was a W0202134. He realized that it was the wrong coil but because he had taken apart the unit he went ahead and sealed all the major leaks, Installed it back. The unit has been working fine. Per Kyle, leave the unit as it is now and if the customer calls back we will send the correct evap coil to get replaced.

Note: Customer, Nick Frei has agreed to call a technician on his own and pay for the service with the understanding that he will be reimbursed by Atosa. I informed the customer  that yes, we will reimburse him and it was approved by management. I will be sending the part for the repair directly to the customer so it can already be on site when the technician arrives. ----> This information should be clarified with the technician:""If parts have been sent prior to your company's diagnosis please keep in mind that we will still expect your technician to do a thorough diagnosis and decide what parts are needed, if any, to repair the unit. The parts we sent are ones we think your technician may need after his/her diagnosis. 
Please contact me if the service call is expected/ begins to exceed $300.
 I have notified the customer of the Atosa Warranty Terms. If the issue is anything maintenance related (dirty filter, insufficient airflow, improper voltage, etc), please bill the customer directly. Atosa is not responsible for maintenance related issues.

Cafe Noura - SKS072018-D1-123

There were already absorbing papers in the pan and it was overflowing when we arrived at 8am this morning.
We added what you sent us.
We also changed the fan parameters and because it sits partially under the hood and next to a grill we changed the defrost settings to six (6) at 20-mins each.
The customer had a pan out and while he eventually relented and put it back thus not being a hole there and letting air in, he didn't think that would have anything to do with it...
in other words, he probably took the pan back out after we left.
Bill said it won't surprise him if you/we don't hear back from him moving forward thus his wanting you all to have these pics.";"2018-07-27 14:38:59.238359";"923 West Forsyth Street";"";"Jacksonville";"FL";"32204";"8AM-9PM";1;"";0;"2018-07-24 15:10:41.866592";0;0
